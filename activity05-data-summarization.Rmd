## Data and packages

Again, we will load all of the `{tidyverse}` for this Activity.

```{r load_packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We continue our exploration of college majors and earnings from the data behind the FiveThirtyEight story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).
Remember that there are many considerations that go into picking a major.
Earning potential and employment prospects are two (important) of these considerations, but they do not tell the entire story.

We read in the same data from Activity 4 below, but notice that this code is now surrounded in parentheses.

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
(college_recent_grads <- read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv"))
```

Compare this code output to the `load_data` chunk in your knitted Activity 4 `.md` report.
What does enclosing an assignment code (i.e., `object_name <- r_code`) in parentheses do?

**Response**: It assigns a value to the object so R can keep track of it and call it up in the environment. 


### Data Codebook

Descriptions of the variables are again provided below.
Again note that the ACS only asks [one question](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/sex/) about a person's sexual identity.

## Analysis

### Median Earnings Description

### Median ... Median Earnings 

For the rest of this semester, I will no longer provide you with R code chunks.
Have no fear!
There are a number of ways to create a code chunk:

- Tired: Copy-and-paste a previous code chunk, delete the code, then add your new code. **This is likely to create more work for you and I strongly encourage you not to use this method.**
- Wired: Click on the ![new chunk icon](README-img/new-chunk-icon.png) and select ![r chunk icon](README-img/r-chunk-icon.png) (notice all the different types of code chunks that you can use within an RMarkdown file!)
- Inspired: Ctrl/Command + Alt/Option + I. *This is my preferred method.*

1. Below, create a code chunk and name it `median_earnings`. Make sure there is an empty line above and below the code chunk.
2. In your newly created R code chunk, verify that the median income for all majors was $36,000.
  - Specify that you want to use the `college_recent_grads` dataset, *then*, using the appropriate functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain the *median* summary statistic for the variable "median earnings of full-time, year-round workers" (this very wordy variable is simply `median` in the dataset).
  - In the appropriate *summarizing* step, refer to your numerical summary `median_earnings`.
  
```{r median_earnings}
college_recent_grads %>%
  summarise (median_earnings = median(median))
```
  

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Additional Summaries of Median Earnings

Often we would like more information than the median to help us to better understand the distribution of a variable.
Note that wWhen I obtain numerical summaries for variables, I like to include the variable name in my summary name (e.g., `median_earnings = median(median)`).

1. Below, create a code chunk and name it `summary_earnings`. Make sure there is an empty line above and below the code chunk.
2. Specify that you want to use the `college_recent_grads` dataset, *then*, using the appropriate functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain the sample size (i.e., *n*umber of observations), *mean*, *s*tandard *d*eviation, *min*imum, *median*, and *max*imum summaries for the variable "median earnings of full-time, year-round workers".
  - Be careful when you name your output summaries as we are dealing with things that could use the same name as functions that you will be using (i.e., "median").

```{r summary_earnings}
college_recent_grads %>%
  summarise (sample_size = n(), mean = mean(median), median_earnings = median(median), standard_deviation = sd(median), minimum = min(median), maxiumum = max(median))

```


Provide a discussion on what you believe the distribution of median earnings will look like.
You should discuss the measures of center, spread, and potential shape only using these values.
DO NOT create any data visualizations here.
Use your understanding of how these numerical summaries are related to the measures of center, spread, and potential shape.

**Response**: A bell curve, weighted on the side of the smaller salaries, with higher salaries being less common until they become outliers.


### Median Earnings by Major Category

Now we will see how the different major categories compare to the overall distribution of median earnings.

*Arrange* this summary table by the median earning.
1. Below, create a code chunk and name it `major_earnings`. Make sure there is an empty line above and below the code chunk.
2. Specify that you want to use the `college_recent_grads` dataset, *then*, using the appropriate functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain the similar summaries of the variable "median earnings of full-time, year-round workers" as your `summary_earnings` code chunk, except now *by* each `major_category`.

```{r}
college_recent_grads %>%
  group_by(major_category) %>%
  summarise (sample_size = n(), mean = mean(median), median_earnings = median(median), standard_deviation = sd(median), minimum = min(median), maxiumum = max(median)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```



Is anything noteworthy when comparing your output from  `summary_earnings` to `major_earnings`?
Also, compare your code in `summary_earnings` to `major_earnings`. 
What is the same? Different?

**Response**: Engineering skews the curve. 


Before we continue, knit your document and take note of what the output for your `major_earnings` code chunk looks like.

Now, add the following to the end of your pipeline (you will need to pipe first) in your `major_earnings` code chunk:

```
knitr::kable()
```

Knit your document and look at the output for your `major_earnings` code chunk.
What changed about the output?
When would this `knitr::kable` code be useful?

**Response**: When there aren't more rows than you want to display, and when you want prettier text outputs. 


![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Visualize Median Earnings by Major Category

Let us see how well your descriptions in the [Median Earnings by Major Category](#median-earnings-by-major-category) section compare to the actual distributions.

1. Below, create a code chunk and name it `major_boxplot`.
2. Plot the distribution of the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers for each `major_category` using the *boxplot* and *jitter* geometries.

```{r major_boxplot}
ggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median, y = major_category)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median, y = major_category)) +
  geom_point()
```


Provide a discussion on how your descriptions in the Median Earnings by Major Category section compares.

**Response**: Sorry, I'm not exactly sure what you're asking here... :/ 


<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/> <b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you feel that you have a good understanding of these commands, feel free to start working on your project. The remainder of this activity will help to expand these commands.

### Multiple Rankings

#### Ranking by `major_category`

The current rankings provided in the data are by `major`.
Here we will develop a series of rankings to see how the `major_category` levels perform.
1. Below, create a code chunk and name it `category_rankings`.
2. In this code chunk, 
  - Group `college_recent_grads` by `major_category`.
  - Summarize the variable `total` as the *sum* across all majors (to get the total number of majors within a `major_category`) and the following variables by their *median* value: `sharewomen`, `unemployment_rate`, and `median` earnings. Provide a meaningful name to each summarized value.
  - Assign/create a *rank* for each summarized value (rank for `total`, rank for `sharewomen`, etc.) and provide a meaningful name to each ranked column value. This ranking function might be confusing. Read the help documentation and ask for clarification. 
  - Arrange the results so that `major_category` appear in alphabetical order ("A" at the top).

```{r category_rankings}
college_recent_grads %>%
  group_by(major_category) %>%
  summarise (total = sum(total), sharewoman_median = median(sharewomen), unemployment_rate_median = median(unemployment_rate), median_earnings = median(median)) %>%
  arrange(major_category)
```


Provide a discussion on how the `major_category` rankings compare.

**Response**: Enginnering makes the most, psych/social work makes the least, but many of the degrees make fairly comparable wages in the middle of the spread. 


![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **(Final) Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.


Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity04-data-pieplines.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
